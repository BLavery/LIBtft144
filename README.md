# lib_tft144

V1.6    April 2015

LCD-TFT-1.44 128x128px.  An SPI library for Raspberry Pi or Virtual GPIO.

The "BLACK" 1.44 board from eBay -    eg http://www.ebay.com.au/itm/141239781210     - under $4!

The "RED" version. eg. http://www.ebay.com.au/itm/400685907981

RED board has a hardware mistake that preconfigures to 128x160 instead of 128x128.
V1.6 of this library corrects for the red board error, but YOU MUST SET "isRedBoard=True" in the TFT144 object constructor.
Otherwise some display modes have screen contents jumbled.

Board has inbuilt 5V-3V (2.9?) regulator (which does NOT break out the 3V!!)
As far as I can discern, logic level is still 3.3V limit, despite supply is 5V.
Currently the code here is designed simply for case of 128x128 pixels.

Added: SPI access, BMP file load, double size fonts, python class, python3/2.7 compatibility
Works on: Rasp Pi GPIO,    or "virtual GPIO" 3.3V   (identical library for both)

On Raspberry Pi, uses SpiDev and RPi.GPIO.


                   THIS BOARD WORKS A TREAT !!!!
