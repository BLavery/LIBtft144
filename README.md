LIBtft144
=========

LCD-TFT-1.44 128x128px.  An SPI library for Raspberry Pi or Virtual GPIO.

The "BLACK" 1.44 board from eBay -    eg http://www.ebay.com.au/itm/141239781210     - under $4!
The "RED" version looks to be identical, but was not tested.

Board has inbuilt 5V-3V (2.9?) regulator (which does NOT break out the 3V!!)
As far as I can discern, logic level is still 3.3V limit, despite supply is 5V.
Currently the code here is designed simply for case of 128x128 pixels.

Added: SPI access, BMP file load, double size fonts, python class
Works on: Rasp Pi GPIO,    or "virtual GPIO" 3.3V   (identical library for both)

On Raspberry Pi, uses SpiDev and RPi.GPIO.


                   THIS BOARD WORKS A TREAT !!!!                   
                   
                   
                   
(As at initial release 14 Oct 2014, "virtual GPIO" V0.9.5 is unreleased. Only V0.9.0 is released.
 So use only on Raspberry Pi GPIO for now.)
